MAZE RUNNER

This is a maze game in which the player is trying to get to the end of the maze before 
certain creatures catch up to him. The player can not go past anything with a # and can only move
up, down, left, or right as can the creatures. The creatures take their turns in order of the alphabet and 
using dijkstra's algorithm, they find the shortest path to the player based on the player's shortest path to the 
end.
